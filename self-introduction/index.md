Hello there. I` m  recording this self-introduction video for Rolling Scopes School. Few words about me. My name is Andrey, I am 30 years old. I live in Minsk, Belarus. I graduated Vitebsk State Technological University in economics, now I’m working as sales development representative in international tobacco company. About one and half years ago I have started to learn programming with Python. Also I learned html, css and Javascript a little bit  on my own about few months so it let me to build frontend part of apps. Also I tried to use Python framework Django to build web applications.

And now I’m learning Javascript on frontend course of Rolling Scopes school .
So why I decided to learn programming? There is some reasons. The first one: with programming you can create everything you want on your own. It` limited only by your own knowledge. Second reason: programming is unlimited place for studying, you can always explore something new, master new technology, make new things.

I found out about this school and frontend course by accident and decided to try. I really liked the structure of course and tasks, because they give a lot of practice, which allows you to master the theory well.
And I think the most important and hard thing for me to struggle is clear time limits. You can`t lose your time and always must learn, keep moving.

I think Rolling Scopes is a great school, it gives a lot of possibilities,  big community, and also it s free and opensource. I hope, that this course will give me possibility to create the different  applications,  in particular I`m interested in progressive web application, because it can be used in different platforms and even without internet connection, just like usual apps in your device.

So I hope this course will help me to master web development and some day help me to become a web developer.
Thanks for you attention and bye.
