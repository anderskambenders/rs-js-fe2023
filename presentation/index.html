          <li>Invented an abstract computer that formalized the definition of an algorithm</li>
          <li>Designed the first computer with a stored program in memory</li>
          <li>Theoretical works on artificial intelligence and the Turing test</li>

        <h4>Turing machine</h4>
        <p>Turing machine is a theoretical device that can simulate any algorithmic computation. </p>
        <ol class="slide3__ol">
          <li>The Turing machine begins with an infinite tape divided into cells, each containing a symbol from a finite set.</li>
            <li>The machine has a read/write head that can move along the tape and read the symbol in the current cell.</li>
            <li>At any given moment, the Turing machine is in a certain state.</li>
            <li>The machine reads the symbol under the head and, based on the current state and symbol, performs a specific action.</li>
            <li>This action can involve writing a new symbol on the tape, moving the head one cell to the left or right, or changing its state.</li>
            <li> The behavior of the Turing machine is determined by its transition function, which maps each combination of current state and symbol to the next state and action to be performed.</li>
            <li>The Turing machine starts in an initial state and continues to execute its actions until it reaches a halting state.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="slide3__desc">Turing machines are considered universal computers as they can simulate any other computer algorithm.</p>

        <h4>Turing completeness</h4>
        <p>Turing completeness is a property of a computational system that can simulate a Turing machine. A computational system is considered Turing complete if it can perform any computation that a Turing machine can, given enough time and resources.</p>
